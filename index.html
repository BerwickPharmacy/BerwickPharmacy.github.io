	<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Information for patients who have prescriptions dispensed at<br />
Berwick Pharmacy and Eden Rise Pharmacy</h3>
	<p>From the 1st of January 2016, pharmacies will have the option of discounting the PBS co-payment by up to $1 per prescription. At Berwick and Eden Rise we are pleased to say that our pharmacies will offer this $1 discount on all co-pay prescriptions. Our discounted price will be the same as the price offered by Chemist Warehouse, Priceline and Terry White, but you will still experience full service, information on your medicines and comfortable surroundings in which to shop.</p>
	<p>However you need to understand that the amount that is “discounted” does not count on your Safety Net Entitlement.</p>
	<p>This means that Concessional patients who choose to receive the full $1 discount will need to fill an <b>additional 11 prescriptions</b> during the year to reach the Safety Net and access free medicines. You will reach the Safety Net later in the year and be on the Safety Net for a <b>shorter length of time</b>.</p>
	<p>The big discount pharmacy chain is advertising the $1 discount but is not mentioning the Safety Net impact on Concessional patients – giving the impression that patients are better off when in fact they are <b>WORSE</b> off over a 12 month period.</p>
	<p>	Additionally some very common medications are being taken off the PBS list, so patients will need to pay for these “over the counter” medicines but these are items that will no longer be recorded on your Safety Net. So every extra dollar spent on prescriptions is actually a better result <b>if you are likely to reach the Safety Net Entitlement card during the year.</b></p>
	<p>At Berwick and Eden Rise Pharmacies we will include the discount automatically when you have your prescriptions dispensed but if you wish to get a better outcome for yourself and your family in gaining access to the Safety Net as soon as possible, you will need to discuss this with our pharmacist who will adjust your file so that the discount is <b>NOT</b> given and the extra $1 per prescription is included in your Safety Net Entitlement.</p>
	<p>We expect most of our patients who usually obtain the Safety Net Entitlement to <b>NOT</b> take the $1 discount per prescription and thereby reach their free script status as <b>early as possible</b> during the year.</p>
	<p>This new initiative by the government can be difficult to understand so if you would like this explained to you in person, please call into Berwick or Eden Rise Pharmacy and discuss with one of our pharmacists.</p>
